# Contact Form Fields

Request form structure used to gate resume access. Built with Contact Form 7, submissions logged via Flamingo.

| Field | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| Name | text | yes |
| Email | email | yes |
| Organization | text | yes |
| Reason for Interest | textarea | yes |

On submission, Flamingo logs the entry and WP Mail SMTP delivers a notification to the resume owner. The visitor does not receive the PDF automatically — delivery is a manual or semi-manual step after review, which is what keeps this an invite-only system rather than an automated download.
